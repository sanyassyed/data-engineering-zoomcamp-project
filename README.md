# Zoomcamp Learning

This repository contains my learning and work that I did while working on the coursework for [Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub). 

I've followed the same repo structure as in the original course and this content is my practice of all the topics taught during the course.

### Folder Descriptions:
