# Zoomcamp Learning

This repository contains my learning and work that I did while working on the coursework for [Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2023](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by [DataTalksClub](https://github.com/DataTalksClub). 

I've followed the same repo structure as in the original course and this content is my practice of all the topics taught during the course.

### Folder Descriptions:

* [week4/README.md](week4/README.md) -> contains `dbt-cloud` instructions
* [homework/workshop_piperider/README.md](homework/workshop_piperider/README.md) -> contains `dbt-core` instructions
