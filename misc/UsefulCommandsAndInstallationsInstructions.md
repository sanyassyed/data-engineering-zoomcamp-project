## BASH / WINGW64
### Activating virtual env on WINGW64

### Setting Environment variables
* Create the environment variables in a file with .bashrc extention eg: `set_env.bashrc`
* Set the environment variables using the keyword 'export' followed by = symbol with no space and its value enclosed in double quotes eg: `export USER='root'`
* Leave the next line empty by pressing enter
* Run the file in bash as follows: `source set_env.bashrc`
* To access the environment variables use `$` sign followed by variable name eg: `echo $USER`
